Green Ball Recgnition with Python 3 Using OpenCV library , 
Program is able to Recognize Green Circular object in normal lighting condition using system's webcam.

#Step 1: Detect the a green colored ball using computer vision techniques such as color processing, noise reduction,determining contour that matches requirements.

#Step 2: Track the ball as it moves around in the video frames, and record its movement in the buffer and show movement information.
